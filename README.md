# sound-programming

This application is the final project for the Sound Programming course of the Master in Game Development I have attended last year.

It is a simple wrapper for fmod https://fmod.com/, it allows the user to configure four predefined channels, loading an audio file, setting the channel volume, pan, playing, stopping and repeating the track.

The GUI of the application has been developed using the Ultralight SDK https://ultralig.ht/
